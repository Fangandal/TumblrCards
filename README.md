# TumblrCards
A text based multiplayer strategy game in the style of the similar card games written by members of the Tumblr Comp Sci community.

We are still in the idea's phase so for now I will be setting up the program to at least generate a 52 card deck to be used for this game.

##### TODO's
- [ ] Generate 52 card deck and player hand
- [ ] Create rules for the card game
- [ ] Create single player game with AI
- [ ] Create multiplayer verion

These TODO's are very broad and this list will grow as new idea's are brought to the table and more people begin to contribute.
