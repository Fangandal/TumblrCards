# TumblrCards
A text based multiplayer strategy card games written by members of the Tumblr Comp Sci community.

We are still in the idea's phase so for now I will be setting up the program to at least generate 
a 60 card deck to be used for this game.

##### IDEAS

We could create suits categories and  have it like an RPG style - with health and energy for attacks 
so taking it turn based, and each card in every category could have certain abilities, health's, manas of their 
own or something? Then att/def points?

What if it's am entirely creature based game? No spells or anything but the creatures have the spell like 
abilities on them? That would make the turn based aspect a lot easier to code because there wouldn't be any 
"instant" type spells. Just triggers on creatures. 

##### TODO's
- [X] Create basic class for a card
- [ ] Figure out a way to quickly generate unique cards with abilities
- [ ] Generate 60 card deck and player hand
- [ ] Create basic entrance and menu system for the game
- [ ] Layout the turn order
- [ ] Create rules for the card game
- [ ] Create single player game with AI
- [ ] Create multi-player version

These TODO's are very broad and this list will grow as new idea's are brought to the table and more people begin to contribute.
